# Mad Libs

  ### By Taylor Somers & Chris Yoon

## Description

  This program is an online madlibs page that allows the user to select one of two madlibs forms to fill in and then generates a hilarious story with the words the user chooses. It was created primarily using C# and .NET, and is the first major project in the May 2020 full-time Epicodus course to integrate our new knowledge of C# with HTML user interfaces.
